# Spelunky

This is my open source Unity fan project of the original Spelunky game made by Derek Yu. I'm not calling it a remake because I have no intention of remaking the game 1:1, nor have I so far taken a single line of code from the actual GameMaker source files. I'm writing all the code myself and I'm making the game how I want it to be in a way that makes sense to me, adding and tweaking features where I see fit along the way. And where I'm using Spelunky as a source of inspiration I'm mainly using the Steam/Xbox 360 remake of the original rather than the original as I feel they look and feel a lot better than the original, for obvious reasons.

I am however using the sprites from the original game as creating art is not my strong suit and the original game has fantastic sprites. Due to this fact the same rules and limitations apply to the sprites here as would to the original GameMaker source files. I've put all the sprites in their own folder in the project along with an amateurish license file that I've made, the purpose of which is to make it absolutely clear that Derek Yu / Mossmouth own the rights to the sprites, not me:  
https://github.com/oyvind-stromsvik/spelunky/blob/master/Assets/Spelunky/Sprites/LICENSE.txt

And if you want to read more about the original game or take a look at the orginal GameMaker source files for yourself, it's all available here:

I'd love it if people contributed with issues and pull requests. One of my primary goals with this project is to increase my programming knowledge, and a great way of achieving that would be if people improved on the things I've made or told me why they're not working or how they could be improved.

I also have an accompaning WIP thread on the Unity forums for this project if you want to follow along:

These are subject to change of course and down the line the plan is for them to be configurable in game as well.

**Jump:** Space / A-button  
**Rope:** Up-arrow / Y-button  
**Bomb:** Right-array / B-button
